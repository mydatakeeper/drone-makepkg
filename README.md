# Archlinux makepkg drone.io plugin

The goal of this repository is to provide [drone.io plugins](http://plugins.drone.io/) performing a Archlinux [makepkg](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Makepkg).

To use them, read the [drone.io docs](https://readme.drone.io). The plugin names are formatted as  `mydatakeeper/drone-makepkg:ARCH` where ARCH is one of the available tag.
